				<p class="lead">First of a product design assignment. Dignitas Digital (former company) has endeavoured to bridge the gap between college education and working environment. Based on our intern hiring and their education standards, it was clear that most engineering colleges were in need of updating their course material. The same 20-year old textbooks were not the right way to impart education. Thus, Diginitas Digital came up with DD-Step program. I was assigned the responsibility of designing its branding and theme. Check out the website <a href="http://ddstep.in/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-8">
				<p class="lead">Along with this initiative was a fun an interactive app to work in tandem with DD Step. The MyQ App is a simple swipe-based app that tests your knowledge related to technology. Answer questions by swiping the screen and become the leader in the community. </p>
				<p class="lead">Gamification model was introduced in the second phase that introduce points based system and rewards based on them. The users were encouraged to refer their friends and peers to gain additional points and unlock other levels, avatars or trophies. The real intent was to make learning fun. With over 5000 installs and growing, this initiative is clearly on thr right track.</p>

				<p class="lead">Research was easy for this app. All the right users were here with us - our interns. They tested environments and areas and provided constant design feedback. We were lucky to have them with us.
				Architecture and design flow was kept simple so as to serve the purpose and breed familiarity with this app. Observing the interns use this app gave me confidence and their answers proved invaluable.</p> </div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-8">
				<p class="lead">Since it was an internal project, we didn't go into designing wireframes and prototypes. The idea was clear in everybody's mind. The logo and brand colors were to be introduced first. We worked on a couple of concepts, but this one here was clearly the favourite. Brand colors were derived from Dignitas Digital logo, which signify integrity and youth.</p>
				<p class="lead">To make it fun, new characters were introduced, those that would ask questions. The inspiration for this was derived from a fun learning app called Duolingo <em>(I am learning Japanese here)</em>. Custom iconography was necessary to make it stand apart from the rest of the apps. Bright colors were selected so as to make the young fall in love with this vibrant app. </p>
